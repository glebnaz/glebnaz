## Work Experience(4 years):

### **[Aliexpress Russia](https://aliexpress.ru/)** Senior Golang Developer, Platform Team (March 2021-now):

> My responsibilities include: development of platform libraries for golang. Platform team is developing its own golang-framework to work based on grpcgateway. Since I started my work when the team was just being formed, I designed from the ground up. Our framework includes many different libraries, I worked on: shared-lock by etcd,db; metrics; corewall(graceful shutdown, debug tools, etc).
The team also supports several platform services: rt-config(realtime config), s2s-auth(service to service auth), dev-portal(Paas). The rt-config service was written only by me.
Since 2022, I have been a team leader of the dcim(data center infrastructure management) team. Our team is developing its own system for the infrastructure department.
